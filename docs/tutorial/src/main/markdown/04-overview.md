# Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to highlight the major features of
SlipStreamâ„¢.  The exercises deal with features that interest
end-users, platform maintainers, and software developers.  As they
build on each other, you will probably want to go through the
exercises in order.

All of the reference ("base") images and deployments are
available in the "Public" project on the server.  The images reference
a StratusLab cloud infrastructure.  You will need to make adjustments
if you are using a different cloud infrastructure.
