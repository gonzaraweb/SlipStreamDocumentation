SlipStream™ provides an ideal platform for deploying and testing
dynamic, near-production environments.  Multi-cloud support takes this
testing to the next level, allowing the behavior of systems to be
tested over the wide area network.

In this chapter, we show how SlipStream™ can be used to define a set
of tests for entire systems, how to debug deployments of systems, and
how to integrate SlipStream™ in your development process.
