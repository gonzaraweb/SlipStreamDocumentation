Important points:

-   Increasingly complex deployments can be made by making small changes
    to existing ones. This evolution follows the natural development
    cycle, but allows simpler deployments to be retained as regression
    tests.

-   Creating new images should only be done where really required. For
    instance, when the machine configuration is complex or
    time-consuming.

-   Using common machine images can be used as a way of ensuring a
    common configuration between different machines. In this case, it
    was used to ensure a common account configuration, including SSH
    keys.

-   General artifacts (as long as they are represented as files) can be
    generated by modules and saved for later use. (This may be
    generalized in the future to allow dependencies to be properly taken
    into account when launching deployments.)
