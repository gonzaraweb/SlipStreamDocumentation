Best Practices
==============

Introduction
============

This section brings together a few good practices we hope will help
users get better results in using SlipStream. The cloud environments
that SlipStream target offers great opportunities that can be leverage
in troubleshooting image and disk creation as well as deployments. The
fact that users can suspend an execution, login to the machine and
perform some of the offending steps by hand is a something that was hard
to do, if at all possible with other distributed development
environments.

The best practices described in this chapter look at how can you
leverage the cloud environment, but we also discuss a few ideas that we
think you might find interesting in terms of building self contained and
reusable units. We start with working with image creation, and we then
move on to deployments.
