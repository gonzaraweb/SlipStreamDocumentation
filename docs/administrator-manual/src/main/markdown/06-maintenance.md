## Adding Users

One the service has been started, you must add the real users to the
system. From the main page click on "Start SlipStream" and log in as
"super". Once logged in, click on the "users" link. Click on the "Add
User" button and fill in the form for each user. You need only fill in
the user name and password. When users first log into their account,
they can provide the remaining information, such as the Amazon
credentials.
