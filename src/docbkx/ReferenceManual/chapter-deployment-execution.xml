    <title>Properties</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>Properties</emphasis> tab lets you access and monitor
    all the runtime properties. These include the input and output parameters
    defined in the machine image nodes as well as any properties created by
    user scripts. Further, a number of SlipStream system runtime properties
    exists and can provide interesting information that you can leverage in
    your scripts. Here we will only cover the most used properties, but for a
    complete list of SlipStream system runtime properties, see Appendix
    XXX.</para>
