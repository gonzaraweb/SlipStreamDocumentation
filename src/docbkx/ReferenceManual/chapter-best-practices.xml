  <title>Best Practices</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This section brings together a few good practices we hope will help
    users get better results in using SlipStream. The cloud environments that
    SlipStream target offers great opportunities that can be leverage in
    troubleshooting image and disk creation as well as deployments. The fact
    that users can suspend an execution, login to the machine and perform some
    of the offending steps by hand is a something that was hard to do, if at
    all possible with other distributed development environments.</para>

    <para>The best practices described in this chapter look at how can you
    leverage the cloud environment, but we also discuss a few ideas that we
    think you might find interesting in terms of building self contained and
    reusable units. We start with working with image creation, and we then
    move on to deployments.</para>
