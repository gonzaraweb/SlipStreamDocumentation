  <title>Authorization</title>

  <para>The <emphasis>Authorization</emphasis> tab allows you to set the
  authorization for this module.</para>

  <para>Note: groups are not yet supported in this version of
  SlipStream.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Access types</emphasis></para>

  <para>Access types are described as follow:</para>

  <para><variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Read</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Read (view) access to the
          module. By selecting this access type, the module becomes visible
          (accessible) to the group or all. It is not possible to de-select
          this access type for owner.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Write</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Write (modify) right to the module. By selecting this access
          type, the module becomes editable to the group or all. It is not
          possible to de-select this access type for owner. Note that since
          most modules in SlipStream (i.e. Project, Machine Image, Disk Image,
          Deployment) are version controlled, saving a module will result in
          creating a new version of the module, without keeping all older
          versions.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Delete</term>
        <!-- TODO clarify the delete logic -->

        <listitem>
          <para>Delete (remove) right to the module. By selecting this access
          type, the module can be deleted (removed) by the corresponding
          owner, group and/or all.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Execute</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Execute (launch) right to the module. By selecting this access
          type, the module can be executed (i.e. images and disks can be
          created, as well as deployment executed) by the corresponding owner,
          group or all.</para>
        </listitem>
