  <title>Separate Worker and Client</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Now we will place the three components of a batch system—server,
    client, and worker—on three separate nodes. The configurations differ only
    slightly from previous deployments, with the server and client
    configurations split.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Worker Configuration</title>

    <para>The worker configuration is identical to the previous
    deployment.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Server Configuration</title>

    <para>The server configuration is similar to the previous deployment
    except that the client configuration has been removed. In addition, the
    server configuration must also include the list of clients that are
    authorized to connect to the server.</para>

    <programlisting>TODO</programlisting>

    <para>The reports script, as before, copies the Torque log files to the
    reports area.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Client Configuration</title>

    <para>The client configuration is also similar to the previous deployment
    except that the server configuration has been removed. Note that the name
    of the batch server must be configured for the client. </para>

    <programlisting>TODO</programlisting>

    <para>The reports script now copies all of the job output to the reports
    area.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment</title>

    <para>The deployment will now consist of three machines. Again the
    synchronization mechanisms are used to ensure that the services have
    properly been initialized before starting the system tests.</para>
