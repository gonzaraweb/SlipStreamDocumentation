    <para>Important points:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Increasingly complex deployments can be made by making small
        changes to existing ones. This evolution follows the natural
        development cycle, but allows simpler deployments to be retained as
        regression tests.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Creating new images should only be done where really required.
        For instance, when the machine configuration is complex or
        time-consuming.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Using common machine images can be used as a way of ensuring a
        common configuration between different machines. In this case, it was
        used to ensure a common account configuration, including SSH
        keys.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>General artifacts (as long as they are represented as files) can
        be generated by modules and saved for later use. (This may be
        generalized in the future to allow dependencies to be properly taken
        into account when launching deployments.)</para>
