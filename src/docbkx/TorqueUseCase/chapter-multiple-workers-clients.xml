  <title>Multiple Workers and Clients</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Production systems almost always contain large numbers of workers
    and clients. Very often problems with services are revealed when
    increasing the number of clients or number of resources in the system. To
    show how to move to a larger deployment to test scalability issues, we
    modify the previous deployment to include 3 workers and 2 clients.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Machine Configuration</title>

    <para>Because we have already anticipated that there will be multiple
    workers and multiple clients, the machine configurations are identical to
    those in the previous case. </para>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment</title>

    <para>This deployment will consist of 6 machines in total: 3 workers, 2
    clients, and 1 server. However, the description of the deployment is
    nearly identical to the previous one, except that the multiplicity of the
    workers is set to 3 and that of the clients, to 2. There are no other
    changes needed in the deployment.</para>

    <para>The returned reports will be provided per machine. In this case, the
    logs from the 3 workers will be provided as well as the logs from the 2
    clients.</para>
